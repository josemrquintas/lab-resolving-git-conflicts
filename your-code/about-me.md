NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ----

<<<<<<< HEAD
# I am JosÃ©

* I am from Portugal but have lived all my adult life in Lisbon
* I studied Business, Jazz School, and worked with startups, as a founder and as a co-worker
* My previous job involved managing the portuguese market for a tech startup that connected independent artists to clients, B2B and B2C.  

# Why am I here

* At my previous job and even in some other academic/startup  projects many times i had to look at the data we were generating to try to understand certain issues. That made me realize the value of data in current companies and how unprepared to deal with this issues I was. Since then, I decided I needed to gain technical skills that could allow me to better work with data.
* During this bootcamp I expect to be able to extract valuable information from extensive datasets. 

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I would like to seek a job in the tech Industry as either a data analyst or in Business Analytics. 
* In my future role I would like to be the one searching for answers to complex problems, to get datasets and extract information from it, and be able to take decisions based on extracted information. 
* My carreer goal is to be able to be a valuable asset to most tech companies, and to be able to work anywhere in the world, as an employee or as a freelancer.
